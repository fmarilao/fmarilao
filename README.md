### Hi there 👋 I'm Facundo

Thanks for visiting my profile!
I have more than 13 years as an entrepreneur, where most of it was in the travel and tourism sector. I am full stack developer of soyhenry bootcamp and currently starting the second year of the associate degree developer in "Instituto Teclab" in order to consolidate the self-taught knowledge acquired. I am eager to start putting my experience in business added to the leadership of teams work in the field of "IT" in which I have always been passionate.
